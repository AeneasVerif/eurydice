# Eurydice

Eurydice is a compiler from Rust to C. The purpose of Eurydice is to provide a
backwards-compatibility story as the verification ecosystem gradually
transitions to Rust. New programs can be written in Rust, in turn making them
safer and easier to verify; but for legacy environments that cannot yet take a
dependency on the Rust toolchain, Eurydice allows generating C code as a stopgap
measure.

Currently (late 2023), the flagship example for Eurydice is Kyber, a
Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithm authored and
verified in Rust for the general public, and [compiled to C via
Eurydice](https://github.com/cryspen/hacl-packages/tree/7a7bfbb17d1d912bdb1a80e86a917e1eec8b6264/libcrux/src)
for Mozilla's NSS library.

In terms of software architecture, Eurydice consumes Rust programs via the
[Charon](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/charon) infrastructure, then extracts
Rust to [KaRaMeL](https://github.com/FStarLang/karamel)'s internal AST via a
type-driven translation. Once in the KaRaMeL AST, 30+ nano-passes allow going
from Rust down to C code. About half of these passes were already implemented
for KaRaMeL, the rest of the passes reuse the KaRaMeL infrastructure but were
freshly written for Eurydice.

# Install

We recommend using Nix to easily ensure you are running the right versions of the tools and
libraries. Our CI uses the `flake.lock` and `flake.nix` files, meaning that you are always
guaranteed a successful build if you use Nix.

Alternatively, you can do a local setup as follows.

```bash
# Step 1: install OCaml environment. Follow instructions, reload your shell, and make sure 
# `eval $(opam env)` has been suitably added to your shell profile.
sudo apt install opam cargo # or brew on OSX
opam init

# Step 2: clone eurydice
git clone https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice
cd eurydice

# Step 3: install dependent projects
# This will clone karamel, charon and libcrux. If you intend to also develop on one of these
# projects, you can symlink your working copy (e.g. `ln -s ../my-charon charon`) instead.
# Note: the invocation for karamel might fail, in which case you want to install all the packages
# in the `depends` field of karamel.opam except fstar. At the time of writing, this means typing:
# opam install ocamlfind batteries zarith stdint yojson ocamlbuild fileutils menhir pprint ulex process fix visitors wasm ppx_deriving ppx_deriving_yojson uucp
make setup-karamel
make setup-charon
make setup-libcrux

# Step 4: ready!
make test
```

# Submitting a successful PR

The C output of the test suite is under version control, and your PR will fail CI if running `make
test` generates a diff for the C files in `out/`. The reason for this is that we need to assess the
impact of a PR on the shape of the generated C code. To make sure the output of the tests is
up-to-date, you can run `make -B test` to force regeneration of the C files.

Our CI will also check that your OCaml and C files have proper formatting -- the target `make
format-apply` reformats your source code to conform to our style guide. It might sometimes be
difficult to have the exact right versions of ocamlformat and clang-format -- in case your PR still
fails, we recommend running `nix develop` followed by `make format-apply`.
